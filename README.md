## About the Project
This project was created as part of my self-learning journey to practice building modern web interfaces using React and utility-first CSS with Tailwind.  
It includes sections such as Hero, Services, About Us, Contact, and a responsive navigation bar.  
The focus was on clean design, smooth layout, and user-friendly structure suitable for a dental clinic.
